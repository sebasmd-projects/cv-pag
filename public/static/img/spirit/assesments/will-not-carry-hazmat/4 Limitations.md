# Exceptions for Operator Equipment and Items of Replacement

## Regulations allow Spirit to take advantage of the following Operator Equipment Exceptions:

### Aviation Fuel and Oil
Aviation Fuel and Oil, when these substances are in tanks that are in compliance with the installation provisions of 14 CFR, Chapter 1.

### Hazardous Materials Required Aboard an Aircraft
Hazardous Materials required aboard an aircraft in accordance with the applicable airworthiness requirements and operating regulations.

### Items of Replacement
Items of Replacement for hazardous materials described above must be transported in accordance with Hazmat Regulations. 

When an operator transports its own replacement items, the following exceptions apply:

- In place of required packagings, packagings specifically designed for the items of replacement may be used, as long as they provide at least an equivalent level of protection to those that would be required.
- Aircraft batteries are not subject to quantity limitations such as those provided in §172.101 or §175.75(c). Spirit DOES NOT currently take advantage of this exception to transport aircraft batteries.

### Hazardous Materials Used by the Operator Aboard the Aircraft
Unless otherwise addressed by FAA regulation or policy (e.g., Advisory Circular), Hazardous Materials used by the operator aboard the aircraft, when approved by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. (e.g., Point-of-sale credit card reader, Electronic manuals device, Spare battery).

## Other Operator Exceptions
Medical Oxygen
Although regulations allow Spirit to provide medical oxygen services to passengers who require this type of service as a condition for traveling, Spirit DOES NOT currently provide such services. 

In accordance with 14 CFR 121.574, Spirit ONLY accepts Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC) devices which are approved by the FAA for onboard use. To be accepted for use onboard, the device must meet one of the following requirements:

The device bears a permanent label on the exterior of the device containing the following certification statement in red lettering: “The manufacturer of this POC has determined this device conforms to all applicable FAA acceptance criteria for POC carriage and use on board aircraft”, or…
The device is approved by the FAA for onboard use. A list of FAA-approved POC devices is maintained in Spirit LiNK. 
Devices that do not meet either of these requirements may be carried but not used onboard.

Dry Ice (Carbon Dioxide, Solid)
Dry Ice (carbon dioxide, solid) intended for use by the operator in food and beverage service aboard the aircraft. Spirit DOES take advantage of this exception.

## Aerosols of Division 2.2 Only
Aerosols of Division 2.2 only (for dispensing of food products), alcoholic beverages, colognes, liquefied gas lighters, and perfumes and portable electronic devices containing lithium cells or batteries that meet the requirements of §175.10(a)(18) carried aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft by the operator for use or sale on that specific aircraft. A liquefied gas lighter design must be examined and successfully tested by a person or agency authorized by the Associate Administrator. 

Spirit DOES take limited advantage of this exception by providing its passengers with alcoholic beverages for sale and consumption onboard that flight and by using hand-held electronic devices to process onboard credit card purchases of food and beverage products for on-board consumption.

However, as a Will-Not-Carry Airline, Spirit is not authorized to transport alcoholic beverages for the purpose of restocking supplies at aircraft catering locations. This is strictly prohibited.

## A Tire Assembly
A Tire Assembly with a serviceable tire provided the tire is not inflated to a gauge pressure exceeding the maximum rated pressure for that tire and the tire (including valve assemblies) is protected from damage during transport.

NOTE: A tire or tire assembly which is unserviceable or damaged is forbidden from air transport; however, a damaged tire is not subject to the HMRs if it contains no material meeting the definition of a hazardous material (e.g., Division 2.2).

Spirit DOES take advantage of this exception by transporting tire assemblies as COMAT. Preparation of such COMAT shall be accomplished by Maintenance personnel only.

## Special Aircraft Operations
The regulation also allows the following hazmat exceptions; However, Spirit does not permit its transportation.
No other provisions of Part 175.9 are applicable to Spirit Operations.

## Safety Recalls

It is Spirit policy to comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Material Regulations (HMR) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instruction (TI) guidance with respect to safety recalls involving the transportation of hazardous materials by air. 

Such guidance may prohibit and/or restrict the carriage of defective/recalled articles by passengers and crew members.

In the event a safety recall involving a hazardous material is issued, Spirit will communicate applicable guidance and instructions to airport personnel and crew members for passenger notification and compliance. 

## Safety Recalls – Batteries and Battery-Powered Devices

Hazmat Regulations prohibit from air transportation:
Recalled Batteries or Battery-Powered Devices 

Batteries or battery-powered devices which are likely to create sparks or generate a dangerous evolution of heat, unless packaged in a manner which precludes such an occurrence.

Lithium Batteries 

Lithium batteries that:

Have been damaged;
Have been identified by the manufacturer as being defective for safety reasons; or
Have the potential of producing a dangerous evolution of heat, fire, or short circuit (e.g., those being returned to the manufacturer for safety reasons).

For Example:

Due to a manufacturer’s safety recall, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), issued an emergency order to ban all Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices from air transportation in the United States.

Gate announcements must be made to advise Guests that federal regulations prohibit the carriage of recalled lithium batteries and recalled lithium-powered devices on the flight. Announcement scripts can be found in GoNow General Reference and Spirit Help (e-GR).

If a Guest self-discloses that they are travelling with a recalled lithium battery/device, they must be rebooked for a later flight (at no additional charge) to give them time to make arrangements for the battery/device.

Any checked bags containing these recalled items must be removed from the flight, and advise the Guest where they can claim them.

Direct Guests to https://www.cpsc.gov/recalls(opens in a new tab) and https://globalrecalls.oecd.org(opens in a new tab) if they have any questions or need further information.

Recalled lithium-powered devices are ONLY allowed if there is regulatory guidance which provides specifics on how to validate that the recalled device or its battery has been replaced, repaired, or otherwise made safe.

Example: Entering the device's serial number on the manufacturer's website for a repair confirmation.
