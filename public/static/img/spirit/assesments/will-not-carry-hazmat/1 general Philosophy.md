# HAZMAT - What is It?
HAZMAT is defined as a substance or material that the Secretary of Transportation has determined can pose an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce.

The term includes hazardous substance, hazardous wastes and materials designated as hazardous in the Hazardous Material Table (49 CFR 172.101) and materials that meet the defining criteria for hazard classes and divisions in 49 CFR 173.

Hazardous Material (DOT term) is known as Dangerous Goods (ICAO, IATA term) in international carriage. The terms are used interchangeably.

In Other words...

Hazmat is any material or substance that can cause harm to passengers, crew members, ground handling personnel, or cause damage to aircraft, equipment, and/or cargo.

Spirit Operates as a Will-Not-Carry Airline.
In accordance with Spirit Ops Specs A004.b paragraph A055, Spirit is not authorized and shall not accept, handle, or carry materials regulated as Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT). 

Spirit - Company Policy
Except for hazmat permitted by 49 CFR parts 175.8, 175.9, and 175.10 (and approved by Spirit), Spirit will not knowingly accept, handle, or transport hazardous materials.

Exceptions
Approved exceptions are described in the “Provisions for Passengers and Crew” and “Limitations” sections of this program.

## Application of Regulations

### Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)

Hazardous Materials Regulations or HMR include the regulations under 49 CFR parts 171 - 180. 
HMR requirements affect Spirit's Airport Services, Flight Operations, Dispatch (OCC), Inflight Services, and COMAT preparation and packaging policies and procedures regarding domestic operations.

### International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 

ICAO Hazmat Regulatory Requirements affect Spirit's Airport Services, Flight Operations, Dispatch (OCC), Inflight Services, and COMAT preparation and packaging policies and procedures regarding international operations.

Although ICAO is the regulatory requirement for international operations, Spirit Airlines utilizes some of the IATA DGRs that are more restrictive than ICAO requirements as company policy. 

Will-Not-Carry Hazardous Materials Operational Manual (WNCH)

This manual contains Spirit Airlines policy and procedures regarding hazmat and is available electronically, on Spirit LiNK > Operations > Airport Services > Station Manuals.

## Hazmat Recognition Training Requirements
Who Must Receive Training?

Will-Not Carry Hazmat Recognition Training is required for Pilots, Flight Attendants, Dispatchers, Catering Personnel, and Airport Services Personnel who perform or directly supervise any of the job functions listed below involving items for transport on board aircraft operated by Spirit Airlines:

Acceptance
Rejection
Handling
Storage (incidental to transport)
Packaging of COMAT/COMAIL
Loading and unloading

Training Objective: Recognition and Refusal

Individuals who successfully complete Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition Training will be able to Recognize and Refuse packages, parcels, baggage, or other cargo that contains or might contain hazardous materials.

Initial Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition Training

This is the basic training required for each newly hired person, or each person changing job functions, who performs or directly supervises any of the job functions previously mentioned. Initial Training must be completed within 30 days of hire, or a change in job function. 

A person may perform the job functions previously mentioned for up to 30 days from the date of hire or a change in job function, but only under the direct visual supervision of someone authorized by Spirit who has successfully completed the Initial or Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition Training Program within the past 12 months. 

Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition Training

Recurrent Training is required for each person who has satisfactorily completed Initial Training and performs or directly supervises any of the job functions previously mentioned.  

Spirit Policy requires that all appropriate personnel (Team Members and Service Providers) receive Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition Training on an annual basis.  

• Airport Services: Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition is received in the First Quarter Training each calendar year.

• Flight Operations: Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition is in accordance with the Flight Operations Training Manual (Ch. 3).

• Inflight Services: Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition is in accordance with the Flight Operations Training Manual (Ch. 4).

• OCC Dispatchers: Recurrent Will-Not-Carry Hazmat Recognition is in accordance with Flight Operations Training Manual (Ch. 5).

• Maintenance and Stores: Recurrent training is in accordance with the Maintenance Training Manual (Ch. 4) and chapter 7 of this manual.

Airport Services shall complete recurrent training in the 1st quarter of each calendar year. Flight Ops, In-flight, OCC, Maintenance, and Stores shall complete recurrent training during their anniversary month, which is the month they completed initial training.

In accordance with §121.1005(d), a person who satisfactorily completes recurrent hazmat training in the calendar month before, or the calendar month after, the month in which the recurrent training is due, is considered to have taken that training during the month in which it is due. If the person completes this training earlier than the month before it is due, the month of the completion date becomes his or her new anniversary month.

Hazmat Training Record Requirements

• Hazardous Material Training Records will be maintained for as long as the employee/service provider is performing these duties and for 36 months thereafter from the most recent training date. 

• The records will be made available to the appropriate Federal Authorities upon request.

• Each certificate holder must maintain a record of all Hazmat Training received within the preceding three (3) years for each person who performs or directly supervises a job function specified in 14CFR.121.1001(a). Spirit also keeps the Initial Hazmat training record. 

## Passenger Notification Requirements
Spirit must display notices to effectively inform passengers about hazardous materials that are forbidden to transport aboard aircraft and the penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.  

Each notice must be in locations where Spirit issues reservations, checks in passengers, checks baggage, and maintains aircraft boarding areas (ticket counters and gates).

During Reservation Purchase
Spirit Airlines must ensure that information about hazardous materials that passengers are forbidden to transport aboard an aircraft is presented at the point of reservation purchase or, if this is not practical, made available in another manner prior to the check-in process. Passengers shall acknowledge that they have been presented with this information.

Spirit Airlines complies with this requirement at the point of reservation purchase (via spirit.com), by requiring passengers to indicate that they agree to the Terms and Conditions (which include the restrictions on hazardous materials in baggage) before they are permitted to complete the purchase process.

During Check-in
Without a Spirit Representative

Regulations require Spirit Airlines to ensure that when the flight check-in process is completed by a passenger without the involvement of another person (e.g., via the web, mobile, or kiosk), information about hazardous materials that are forbidden to transport aboard an aircraft is presented to passengers. The passenger must acknowledge that they have been presented with this information, and agree they understand the restrictions and do not have hazardous materials in their baggage.

Spirit Airlines complies with this requirement during the flight check-in process (via the web, mobile, or at the kiosk), by presenting the passenger a HAZMAT screen that explains the restrictions on hazardous materials in baggage.

The passenger is required to acknowledge that they understand before they are permitted to continue the check-in process.

With a Spirit Representative

When the check in process is conducted in person (e.g., at the airport with the assistance of a Spirit representative), passengers are presented with information about hazardous materials that are forbidden to transport on aircraft. 

Spirit Airlines complies with this requirement by displaying Advice to Passenger signage at all ticket counter and gate locations.

In addition to the Advice to Passenger signage, Guest Service Agents assisting passengers with check-in and acceptance of checked baggage (ticket counter, gate, or remote check-in area) must ask passengers if they are traveling with any hazardous materials. 

When to Ask the Hazmat Question
During check-in and checked baggage acceptance (ticket counter, gate, or remote check-in area) passengers must provide verbal confirmation when a GSA asks if they are travelling with any HAZMAT.

What to Ask?
You can say something like: “Are you traveling with any hazardous material today?” or other more specific verbiage already in use at your station.

Also Remember...
Passengers may be referred to the Advice to Passenger signage for information on materials that are forbidden to transport on aircraft. They can also reference Spirit.com/hazmat.

What if the Passenger is Transporting HAZMAT?
In that case, and prior to accepting the baggage, Spirit must follow the procedures in the Will-Not-Carry Hazardous Materials Operations Manual, Chapter 2. Contact your supervisor if in doubt.

To Clarify "Baggage Acceptance"
Checked baggage acceptance occurs when Spirit activates an automated bag tag or when a manual bag tag (e.g. gate check, gate claim) is issued.

To Clarify "Baggage Acceptance"
Carry-on baggage acceptance occurs when the boarding pass is scanned at the gate.

## General Philosophy

For transportation purposes, hazmat is generally divided into three types:

1 ACCEPTABLE: Means the material is classified, packaged, marked, labeled, and documented in accordance with 49 CFR and may be offered for transportation or transported by air.
Spirit is NOT authorized to transport “Acceptable” hazmat.

2 FORBIDDEN: Means the material may not be offered for transportation or transported by air.
Airlines are NOT allowed to transport “Forbidden” hazmat.

3 EXCEPTIONS: Means those articles of hazmat that, because of the type of material, small quantities, necessity or requirement for flight, may be   transported by air in accordance with 49CFR 175.8, 175.9, and 175.10. NOTE: Spirit does not utilize the exceptions permitted by 175.9. 

Spirit transports EXCEPTIONS, but only in accordance with the “Provisions for Passengers and Crew” and “Limitations” sections of this program.
