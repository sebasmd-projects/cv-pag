# Provisions for Passengers and Crew

There are exceptions to 49 CFR Parts 171-180, found in Part 175.10, that permit passengers and working Crew Members to carry certain limited quantities of hazardous materials on board the aircraft in carry-on baggage or checked baggage.

This section details the exceptions and list the conditions that must be met for these items to be considered exceptions. There will be a regulatory text allowing the exception. Note that in some cases, Spirit policy is more restrictive than the regulations.  

The exceptions provided on this section also apply to aircraft operators when transporting passenger or Crew Member’s baggage that has been separated from them, including transfer to another carrier for transport to its final destination.
