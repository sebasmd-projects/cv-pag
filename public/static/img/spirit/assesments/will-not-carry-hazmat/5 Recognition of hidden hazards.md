# Recognition of Hidden Hazards

Hidden Hazards

Crew Members and individuals performing or directly supervising the following job functions must be able to recognize certain conditions, indications, or situations where the potential exists for hazardous materials to be introduced into the system: Acceptance; Rejection; Handling; Storage Incidental to Transport; Loading; or Packaging of COMAT. 


##  Details for some of the more common indicators

### Aircraft Replacement Parts/COMAT (Includes used parts to be sent back to a maintenance base) 

These items may contain explosives (flares or other pyrotechnics), chemical oxygen generators, unserviceable tire assemblies, cylinders of compressed gas (Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen or fire extinguishers), paint, adhesives, aerosols, life-saving appliances, first aid kits, fuel in equipment, wet or lithium batteries, parts with residual fuel, etc. 

Except for a serviceable tire assembly (as discussed in the Limitations section of this program), Spirit will not knowingly transport COMAT that may contain hazmat (i.e., aircraft replacement parts).

### Automobile/Motorcycle Parts 
These items may be small engines, carburetors or fuel tanks which contain or have contained fuel, also wet batteries, compressed gases in tire inflation devices, fire extinguishers, shocks/struts with nitrogen, air bag inflators/air bag modules, etc.

### The Words “Tank” or “Cylinder” 

Might indicate possible compressed gas, chemical oxygen generators, or refrigerated liquefied oxygen.

### Camping Equipment 

May contain flammable gases (Butane, Propane, etc.), flammable liquids (Kerosene, Gasoline, etc.), flammable solids (Hexamine, matches, etc.) or other dangerous goods.

### Chemicals

Most chemicals have at least 1 class of dangerous goods, particularly flammable liquids, flammable solids, oxidizers, organic peroxides, toxic or corrosive substances. Dangerous chemicals must never be accepted as baggage.

### Company Materials (COMAT) 

Questionable COMAT packages must be inspected to ensure they do not contain hazmat, except for a serviceable tire assembly in accordance with the operator exceptions permitted by HMR 175.8 (previously mentioned).


### Diving Equipment 

May contain scuba tanks and spare air tanks (smaller version of a scuba tank). These are not allowed. 

Spirit Airlines policy prohibits acceptance and transportation of scuba tanks.

High intensity diving lamps generate extremely high heat if operated in air, to be accepted for transportation, the bulb, or battery must be disconnected.


### Electrical Equipment 

This type of equipment may contain magnetized materials or mercury in switches and electron tubes or wet batteries.

### Electrical or Battery Powered Apparatus 

This type of equipment may contain wet batteries (e.g., wheelchairs, lawn mowers, golf carts).

### Expeditionary Equipment 

May contain explosives (flares), flammable liquids (gasoline), flammable gas (propane, camping gas) or other dangerous goods.

### Film Crews or Media Persons 

Baggage may contain explosive pyrotechnic devices, generators incorporating internal combustion engines, wet batteries, fuel, heat producing items, etc.

### Frozen Foods, Meats or Fish 

Packages containing these types of perishables might contain Carbon Dioxide Solid (Dry Ice) as a coolant.

### Magnets

It is important to question any mention of magnets, the size and quantity may make them unsafe to travel.   Speakers have magnets.

### Electronic Cigarettes or E-cigarettes 

These devices may not be used on board but may be transported in carry-on baggage. 

E-cigarettes and other battery-powered smoking devices are not permitted in checked baggage.

### Medical Supplies 

Many medical liquids are flammable. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer. There is a quantity maximum on these items. Check to ensure the maximums are not exceeded.

### Canned Oxygen 

In accordance with DGAB-14-01 (Dangerous Goods Advisory Bulletin).

Sold in some airports, these products contain compressed oxygen in metal containers. As such they are hazmat and not allowed on commercial aircraft in checked or carry-on baggage. 

In accordance with 14 CFR 121.574, Spirit ONLY accepts Portable Oxygen Concentrator devices which meet one of the requirements previously mentioned.

### Passenger Baggage 

Agents have no way of knowing what a passenger baggage might contain.  Agents should listen for clues and (if warranted) ask questions as to what they are transporting (fireworks, flammable household liquids, corrosive oven or drain cleaners, flammable gas or liquid lighter refills or camping stove cylinders, matches, ammunition, bleach, aerosols).

### Refrigerators and Air Conditioners 

These items may contain liquefied gases (Freon) or an ammonia solution. These chemicals are not allowed on the aircraft.


### Repair Kits 

Many chemical solutions may be found in a simple repair kit. Ask about flammable adhesives, solvent-based paints or resins.

### Swimming Pool Chemicals 

These may contain oxidizing or corrosive substances.

### Toolboxes

These containers may carry explosives (power rivets), compressed gases or aerosols, flammable gases (butane cylinders or torches), flammable adhesives or paints, corrosive liquids, etc. 

### Chemical Oxygen Generator (COG)

In Accordance with DGAB-07-02 (Dangerous Goods Advisory Bulletin).

Recognize the Terms: Some commonly used industry terms, COMAT descriptions, or aircraft components that may contain chemical oxygen generators are:

COG
Generator
O2 Generator or O2 GEN
Oxygen Generator or Oxy Gen
Oxygen Module or Oxy Box or Oxy Mod
Passenger Service Unit or PSU
Protective Breathing Apparatus or PBA
Protective Breathing Equipment or PBE
Smoke Hood

Recognize the Equipment: 

Oxygen generators are often contained in or are an integral part of aircraft components like Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE) and Passenger Service Units (PSU).

COGs are forbidden as cargo on passenger-carrying aircraft.

Since 2001, the FAA has investigated over 80 incidents of undeclared or improperly prepared oxygen generators. Combined, the subjects of these investigations have paid over $3,000,000 in civil penalties to the U.S. Federal Government.
