# Labeling and Marking

SPIRIT POLICY:
Except for hazmat permitted by 49 CFR parts 175.8 and 175.10 (and approved by Spirit), Spirit will not knowingly accept, handle, or transport   hazardous materials.

To effectively comply with this policy, it is imperative that all individuals involved in the acceptance, handling, and transporting of cargo (COMAT/COMAIL) and baggage be able to RECOGNIZE and REFUSE any package, parcel, baggage, or other cargo (COMAT/COMAIL) that contains (or might contain) materials or substances regulated as hazmat.

Therefore, these individuals need to know how to identify cargo (COMAT/COMAIL) and baggage that contains (or might contain) regulated hazmat.

The Table of Hazardous Materials assigns each regulated material or substance to a category or class according to the type of hazard it presents.

Individuals who package or prepare packages of regulated hazmat for transportation are required by federal regulation to label each package accordingly.

Packages of regulated hazmat will bear certain labels and/or markings in accordance with the category or class to which the hazmat is assigned.

Our goal is to be able to recognize any such package and subsequently refuse acceptance, handling, or transportation.

## Hazard Class

Means the category of hazard assigned to a hazardous material under 49 CFR part 173 and the provisions of the §172.101 table. 

There are nine (9) hazard classes, and some are further divided into class divisions.

## Hazard Label

Hazmat classes and divisions are identified by warning labels which are affixed to (or preprinted on) a package to indicate the type of hazard the package presents.

## Class 1 - Explosives
Examples: Grenades, mines, nitroglycerin, ammunition, airbags, signal smoke, and tracers for ammunition, etc.

Class Division	Division Name
1.1	Explosives that have a mass explosion hazard
1.2	Explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard
1.3	Explosives that have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard
1.4	Explosives that present a minor explosion hazard
1.5	Very insensitive explosives
1.6	Extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosion hazard


Recognize and Refuse any package, parcel, baggage, or other cargo (COMAT/COMAIL) that bears any of these Hazard Class 1 warning labels.
