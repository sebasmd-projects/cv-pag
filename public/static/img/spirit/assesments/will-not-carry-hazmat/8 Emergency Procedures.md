On the Ground

Will-Not-Carry Hazardous Materials Operations Manual - Section 6.2

In the event of a hazmat spill, fire or other incident, do the following:

1 Evacuate all personnel to a safe distance. If explosives are involved, this distance should be one-quarter mile or more. If the incident is in the SIDA area, keep security measures in place. Keep the unauthorized people in a group and have someone authorized to be there and help retain the security of the area, if possible.

2 If clouds, vapors, fumes, etc., are present, move all personnel upwind. Avoid inhaling fumes, smoke and vapors even if no hazardous materials are involved.

3 Notify ERI Provider, station management, local fire and police departments. Make certain they are aware that hazardous materials are involved and give them as much information about the material as possible.

4 Continue to keep all personnel away from the spill or accident area. Under no circumstances should anyone approach close enough to come into contact with any of the spilled material, fire, or pieces of debris.

5 Do not assume that gases or vapors are harmless because of lack of smell.

6 Local management will contact OCC and provide the following information as appropriate:  aircraft number, description of occurrence, time of occurrence, flight number, location of the occurrence, and immediate assistance required, if any.

7 Follow instructions and guidance from local emergency responders, management personnel, and/or OCC.
